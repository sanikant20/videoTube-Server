<h1>Backend Production Level Learning - NodeJS </h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

This repository contains the source code for a nodejs backend project. The project is designed to demonstrate the use of nodejs and expressjs for building a scalable and secure web application.

You have to initilize the `.env` file in the root directory by yourself manually.

The project is organized into the following modules:

- **Controllers**: This module contains the logic for handling incoming requests and generating responses. This is where the business logic for the application should be implemented.
- **Models**: This module contains the logic for interacting with the database. This is where the data models for the application should be defined.
- **Utils**: This module contains utility functions that can be used across the application.
- **Routes**: This module contains the routes for the application. Each route is associated with a controller that handles the request and generates a response.


The main entry point for the application is the `app.js` file. This file contains the top level logic for the application including the routes and middleware configuration. The `app.js` file imports the routes from the `routes` module and mounts them on the server.

The `index.js` file is the entry point for the application in a production environment. This file is responsible for setting up the server and listening for incoming requests.

The `package.json` contains the configuration for the project, including the dependencies and scripts.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies with npm by running: `npm install`

To run the application, you can run the `npm run dev` command in the root directory. This will start the development server.
